<h1>What is Kiirti ?</h1>
<h4>Kiirti is a one-stop citizen reporting and tracking platform to enable awareness and citizen engagement in India.</h4>

<h1>How to use Kiirti ?</h1>
<h4><ul>
<li>As an NGO or a concerned individual, you can create and own an instance to track incidents related to a specific cause or issue (e.x., child labor in patna, street crimes in mumbai, potholes in bangalore, ...)
<li>As a user, you can help by reporting about issues in your locality - e.x. dangling electric wire in your street, domestic violence in your neighbourhood, corruption at local registrar office, etc. Our volunteers and partner organizations/NGOs are committed to help moderate incoming reports, aggregate common issues, follow-up with the right authorities and providing regular status updates on the site.
</ul></h4>

<h1>Who helped build Kiirti ?</h1>
<h4><a href="http://www.emoksha.org">eMoksha</a>, a non-partisan non-profit, conceived the idea and made it a reality by extending <a href="http://www.ushahidi.com">Ushahidi</a> to support Multiple Hosted Instances (MHI), which is the backbone of Kiirti. Ian Pye, is the key technical architect who built Ushahidi MHI support, with guidance and help from Brian Herbert.</h4>

<h1>How can we help ?</h1>
<h4><ul>
<li>First and foremost, you can help by using Kiirti daily/regularly, to report about various issues in your locality. 
<li>Second, identify a cause you are passionate about and create an instance to track related incidents, thereby enabling awareness and change.
<li>Third, become a volunteer to help moderate reports or build new features or promote adoption or help with many other little tasks.  Mail <a href="mailto:contact@kiirti.org">us</a> for more details.
<li>Finally, help us scale by becoming a financial donor. Mail <a href="mailto:contact@kiirti.org">us</a> for more details.
