  In 1998, during an eight-month long stay in India on a Senior Research Fellowship from The American Institute of Indian Studies, Dr. Chandra Shekhar Balachandran found that Geography as a discipline was under-valued and under-utilized in developmental work, and that poor state of Geography education was a large part of the problem. He conceptualized a structure to promote Geography as a tool of analysis and as a discipline of study in its own right. He spoke to many friends and family who all have contributed generously in various ways to bring about the establishment of <b>The Dharani Trust</b> in <b>1999 </b>and its evolution since then. <b>The Indian Institute of Geographical Studies</b> is the first initiative of Dharani.
