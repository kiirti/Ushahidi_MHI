5th Pillar is an organization that strongly believes that the people that make up a democracy are the strongest members of such a system. Without the people a democracy would not exist. As such, we believe that if each one of us changes our own habits, we will be attacking corruption at its roots, and corruption will cease to exist.

  In 1998, during an eight-month long stay in India on a Senior Research Fellowship from The American Institute of Indian Studies, Dr. Chandra Shekhar Balachandran found that Geography as a discipline was under-valued and under-utilized in developmental work, and that poor state of Geography education was a large part of the problem. He conceptualized a structure to promote Geography as a tool of analysis and as a discipline of study in its own right. He spoke to many friends and family who all have contributed generously in various ways to bring about the establishment of <b>The Dharani Trust</b> in <b>1999 </b>and its evolution since then. <b>The Indian Institute of Geographical Studies</b> is the first initiative of Dharani.
