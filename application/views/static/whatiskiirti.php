	<span class="copy">
	Kiirti's approach to enabling transparency and citizen engagement, is by using cutting-edge open-source internet and mobile technologies; beginning with allowing citizens to easily report, view and discuss any governance related issue. As many NGOs and local civic organizations are already doing a fantastic job in the areas of effective governance, we will partner with such organizations to provide independent access to the Kiirti platform (under a chosen subdomain, e.x. fixourcitydelhi.kiirti.org). The platform will provide the ability to collect and aggregate issues/data directly from citizens through phone,sms, email, web, etc and tools to visualize and forward the issues to the right authorities for resolution. Below is a picture describing a general use case.
